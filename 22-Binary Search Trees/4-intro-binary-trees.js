/*Kinds of trees*********
*Trees
*Binary trees - Each node can have at most two children at the binary part. Not three
*binary search trees- are a special case of a binary tree.

**In BST - all numbers less than the root goes to the left side- 
    **others(greater than root) go to the right side. We could repeat that on each child node

****How bst works*****
*Every parent node has at most 2 children
* Every node to the left of a parent node is always less than the parent
* Every node to the right of a parent node is always greater than the parent
