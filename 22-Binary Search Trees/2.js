/*What is a tree ?
**A data structure that consists of nodes (just like linked list did) in a parent/child relationship.
**Each node can point to more than one or can have more than one reference to another node
**One root node- there is only one entry point
**Lists - linear.. Trees- non-linear.. 
*In trees - thers's many different paths we could take
*In lists- there's only one pathway through

**In a tree - every node is moving away from the root node in a parent-child relationship

**Root- The top node in a tree
**Child - A node directly connected to another node when moving away from the root
**parent - The converse notion ofa child
**siblings - A group of nodes with the same parent
**Leaf - A node with no children
**Edge - The connection between one node and another
